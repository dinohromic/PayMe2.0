We were not able to find out how to run this program in the CMD, sorry :( Please run it through Android Studio until we find out.

Step 1:
Download Android Studio.

Step 2:
Create a new project in Android Studio from Version Control and use the URL from this Git.

Step 3:
All you need to do now is to set up a device (for example the Pixel 3 API 30) and then run the program. (If the virtual device says "The UI has stopped working", just click on any of the buttons and the program will continue (this is a problem with the virtual device itself)
